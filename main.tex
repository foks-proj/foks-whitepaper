\title{The Federated Open Key Service (FOKS)}

\begin{abstract}

This paper presents FOKS (Federated Open Key System), a
decentralized key management system designed to provide secure and flexible key
distribution across federated networks. The basic problem addressed is that of
of two parties sharing end-to-end encrypted data across the internet, where both
parties have several devices. They might rotate devices, form mutable teams with
other users, or even teams of teams in an arbitrary graph. They need to share
secret key material to facilitate symmetric encryption, and this material must
rotate whenever devices are replaced, or team membership changes.  This is a
very natural problem but one that still lacks an adequate solution.  Morever, we
believe key management should not lock users into a particular, walled provider,
but instead, should allow for federation and independent management of server
resouces, as we see in HTTP and SMTP.  We describe the system architecture,
security model, and implementation details of a system that achieves secure,
federated key exchange, and enables useful applications like end-to-end
encrypted data sharing and git hosting.

\section{Related Work}

The initial inspiration for FOKS is the SUNDR project~\cite{sundr}, which first
originated the idea of a fork-consistent blockchain of edits facilitated by a
untrusted server.  Like Keybase~\cite{keybase}, FOKS applies this basic
architecture to the problem of key distribution, rather than the data those keys
might secure. Many other projects have riffed on this, from
CONIKS~\cite{melara2015coniks}, to the SEAMless~\cite{chase2019seemless} work
out of Microsoft Research, to the widespread adoption of Key Transparency
Signal, WhatsApp and iMessage.  The question of federation has largely been
ignored, as these sytems all shared the basic architecture of a single upstream
server.
