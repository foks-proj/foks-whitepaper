\section{Applications}

The goal of the FOKS system is primarily: for a user or a group of users to
agree upon a sequence of cryptographic keys so they can perform authenticated,
end-to-end encryption of arbitrary data. Specific applications might have
different requirements as to the number of keys in that set, and the candence at
which they are destroyed. For chat-style applications like Signal or WhatsApp,
it appropriate to introduce new keys consistently and to destroy old keys as
quickly as possible, as there is no requirement to recover historical messages.
For other applications, like email, file systems, and long-term key-value
storage, recovering ``historical'' data is a requirement. New user devices and
new members in teams expect access to all relevant documents in the system, not
just those authored since they joined.
