    abstract =  {Messaging applications are increasingly making use of end-to-end security mechanisms to ensure that messages are only accessible to the communicating endpoints, and not to any servers involved in delivering messages. Establishing keys to provide such protections is challenging for group chat settings, in which more than two clients need to agree on a key but may not be online at the same time. In this document, we specify a key establishment protocol that provides efficient asynchronous group key establishment with forward secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS) for groups in size ranging from two to thousands.},

E2E security protects users' communications from tampering or inspection by intermediaries that are involved in delivering those communcations from one logical endpoint to another. In addition to the much-discussed E2E encryption systems, true E2E security requires an identity mechanism that prevents the communications provider from impersonating participants in a session, as a way to gain access to the session. This document describes a high-level architecture for E2E identity, identifying the critical mechanisms that need to be specified.},
